# Algorithms

My implementation of some algortihms. The list of algorithms is continuously populated.

## Contents:

* calculation of the nth Fibonacci number (recursive [slow] and fast implementation [with memoization])
* determination of the remainder from division of the nth Fibonacci number by an integer
* merge sort
* checking for correctness of a parentheses sequence
* tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
