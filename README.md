# Algorithms

My implementation of some algortihms. The list of algorithms is continuously populated.
What's covered in this repository includes various approaches to solving algorithmic tasks. This includes the following important topics in computer science:
- [greedy algorithms](/greedy)
- [divide & conquer](/divide_and_conquer)
- dynamic programming

The repository is continuously updated with new problems and solutions in various topics on algorithms.
