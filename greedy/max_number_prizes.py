# The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise
# distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as
# a 1 + a 2 + · · · + a k where a 1 , . . . , a k are positive integers and a i ̸ = a j for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k.
